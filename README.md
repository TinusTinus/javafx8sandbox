JavaFX 8 Sandbox
================

Some simple sample programs, demonstrating some of the new features in JavaFX 8.

After cloning this repository, src/main/java contains all Java source files and src/main/resources contains all required resources. This project does not depend on any external libraries, all it needs is JDK8.

If you're interested, you can also check out the following two JavaFX projects which I have migrated from JavaFX 2 to JavaFX 8:
* [Tinustris](https://github.com/TinusTinus/tinustris), a game based on Tetris, which uses JavaFX for the GUI and realtime graphics;
* [Replay Manager](https://github.com/TinusTinus/replaymanager/tree/java8), a tool for managing video game replays, with a user interface built with JavaFX components.
